  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <p class= "block-text">In this experiment, we would like you to imagine that our store has compiled an inventory list for insurance purposes. Unfortunately, the store only had one copy of the paper where we wrote all this information, and that paper has been badly treated. The prices have faded away and been lost. We would like your best guess as to what those prices should be.</p>
  <p class= "block-text">We can get a little bit of information about the price by looking at the the color and font of each entry. Items that cost more than <span class="cutoff">{{}}</span> have to be declared seperately and require additional paperwork, so these are written in <span style="color: #0000ff; font-style: italic">blue italics</span>. Please only guess a price above <span class="cutoff">{{}}</span> if the entry is written in <span style="color: #0000ff; font-style: italic">blue italics</span>, and please only guess a price below (or equal to) <span class="cutoff">{{}}</span> if the entry is written in plain black text.</p>
  <p class= "block-text">Although we know that you cannot recover the original prices exactly, keep in mind that it is in the store's best interest if your guesses are as close to the original prices as possible.</p>
  <p class= "block-text">Please click "Begin" when you're ready to start.</p>
