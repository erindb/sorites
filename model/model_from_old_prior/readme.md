I run the model on two different priors: the ebay scraped priors and the V4 bins prior (see those folders for more info).

I run the model with two different parameter settings:
	* settings 1: The cost of the ("expensive") utterance is 1 and alpha (rationality parameter) is 1.
	* settings 2: The cost of the ("expensive") utterance is 6 and alpha (rationality parameter) is 5.
