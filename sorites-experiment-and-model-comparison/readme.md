We ran two versions of the sorites experiment, which we aggregate for most of the data analysis.

The first version, V1, was run on Jan-31-2014 and on Feb-05-2014. This version used the phrasing:

An X that costs $E less than an expensive X is is also expensive.

The second version, V2, was run on Feb-06-2014. This version used the phrasing:

If an X is expensive, then another X that costs $E less is also expensive.

The change between these experiments was made in this commit:

Therefore, in the results file `sorites-jan31.csv`, the first 70 participants saw version V1 (last participant accepted at Thu Feb 06 13:18:30 PST 2014) and the next 50 participants saw version V2 (first participant accepted at Fri Feb 07 05:14:52 PST 2014).
