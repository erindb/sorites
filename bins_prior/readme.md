My data collection was messy.
I didn't include all the information about what i
was showing participants in my data files.
By going through previous analyses and my git log,
I collected the following metadata.

prior-dec4.csv
  The first 21 Ss of this file were run on version V1
  where there were 10 bins for each item.
  The next 17 Ss were run on version V2 where there
  were 20 bins for each item.


prior-dec4-jan9
  ** The first 10 Ss of this file were run on version V3
  where there were 40 bins for each item.
  ** The next 10 Ss were run on version V4 where the number
  of bins was large and varied by item.
  The next 20 Ss were run on V5: the posterior (after hearing
  the adjective was true).


prior-feb12.csv
  ** For this file, we varied domain between Ss (V6). Some
  people saw "expensive", some "tall", and some "old".
  Also between Ss, we varied whether participants saw
  the prior or posterior version. The number of bins
  varied by item.

** represents data that had good enough range and resolution to be worth analyzing
For the model, I normalized and then smoothed and took bins the width of the smallest epsilon times 5 (so the last epsilon doesn't really have a chance).
